5. **Flexibility**: If not enough finance stories available, include general business stories with financial implications
6. **Relevance**: Stories that would educate and inform Indian investors, financial professionals, and business enthusiasts

FOR EACH STORY, PROVIDE:
- **title**: Compelling, SEO-friendly headline (60-80 characters)
- **summary**: 2-3 sentence summary highlighting key impact and implications (150-200 words) - DO NOT mention source name or "according to" references

  * Engaging introduction
  * Key details and context
  * Market/business implications
  * Expert analysis or quotes if available

- **key_numbers**: Important financial figures, percentages, or data points from the story
- **image_info**: Find and provide real image URLs when possible

IMAGE REQUIREMENTS:
For each story, try to find:
1. **Direct image URLs**: Look for images from the original news source or related official sources
2. **Free stock images**: Provide direct download URLs from Unsplash, Pexels, or similar free platforms
3. **Image accessibility**: CRITICAL - Ensure all image URLs are accessible and return valid images (not 404 errors)
4. **Image attribution**: Include proper attribution and license information
5. **NO WATERMARKS**: CRITICAL - Only use images that are completely watermark-free and clean


IMPORTANT IMAGE ACCESSIBILITY RULES:
- Test image URLs before including them
- For Unsplash: Use direct image URLs that work (avoid expired or moved links)
- For Pexels: Ensure URLs are current and accessible
- If an image URL returns 404 or is inaccessible, do NOT include it
- Better to have no image than a broken image URL
- **WATERMARK CHECK**: Verify that images do NOT have any watermarks, logos, or text overlays before including them
- **CLEAN IMAGES ONLY**: Only use professional, clean images without any branding, watermarks, or text overlays

PREFERRED IMAGE SOURCES:
- Original news article images (if available and watermark-free)
- Unsplash financial/business images with direct download URLs (watermark-free versions only)
- Pexels professional images with direct links (clean, no watermarks)
- Company logos or official images (if publicly available and clean)
- **AVOID**: Any stock photo sites that add watermarks or require attribution overlays

IMAGE OUTPUT FORMAT:
\`\`\`json
"image": {
  "url": "direct_download_url_here", // MUST be accessible and working (no 404 errors)
  "source": "unsplash/pexels/news_source",
  "attribution": "Photo by [Author] on [Platform]",
  "license": "license_type",
  "alt_text": "descriptive_text_for_accessibility"
}
\`\`\`

QUANTITY REQUIREMENT:
Target 5 stories if available, but provide between 2-5 stories. Quality over quantity - better to have 2-3 excellent stories than forcing 5 mediocre ones.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return as clean JSON array with 2-5 stories, ensuring each story is complete, well-researched, and relevant to the FinLook audience interested in finance and business.

CRITICAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Source Removal**: Do NOT mention "source", "according to [source name]", or any reference to the original news source in the title, summary, content, tags, or any other field except source_name and source_url.
2. **Link Removal**: Remove ALL links, URLs, and external references from within the content. Read the full source article and strip out any embedded links, source references, or external URLs.


IMAGE URL VERIFICATION: Before including any image URL, ensure it is accessible and returns a valid image. Test Unsplash, Pexels, and other free platform URLs to confirm they work. If an image URL is broken or returns 404, do not include the image field at all. **CRITICAL**: Only use images that are completely free of watermarks, logos, or text overlays. Verify image quality and cleanliness before including.

Focus on stories that would help FinLook users make better financial and business decisions - market analysis, policy impacts, business developments, startup news, economic indicators, corporate earnings, etc.`,
